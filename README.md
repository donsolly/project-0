# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Brief Overview:

The site describes three sites owned by NDPHC (I work at one of their plants so why not write something related to what I do)

*Homepage*
The home page contains a NAVbar with a link to the three plants I decided to talk about.
There is a slide on the homepage and a table also on the homepage

*Geregu/Benin/Omotosho Pages*
All have similar navbar and shows features of each of their respective files

*Disclaimer* 
The descriptions used and the detail of the plant was fetched off the internet and were not composed by me
*End Disclaimer
